why am i here?

to announce that our Creator sent Jesus His only begotten Son to show us and tell us how to Live, and to die in our place since we have all failed to do as He did and said, and our Creator raised Him from the dead to confirm His approval of Jesus, and to give us hope and new Life in Him.  i believe that He has preserved this Message, more accurately than i could ever hope so summarize, for us in the Bible.  as a result, one of the things i believe He wants me to do is to use my skills and experience as a former public school scpecial needs worker, and my small amount of training in using technology to make things accessible to all people, to make the Bible more accessible to all people.  i joined github to help test, review and advise the developement of software improvements to make audio Bibles in all languages, as well as the learning of the Original hebrew, aramaic and greek, more accessible to everyone and every nation and language group.
